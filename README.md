# Nag Log

This is an automation of a productivity technique I use very often, which involves journaling every 10 minutes.

The system should provide a timer that can be started. Then, once 10 minutes are up, it plays a sound and switches to a textbox screen, giving 60 seconds to journal (the number 60 may be adjusted later). Once time is up, the new timer will begin, and so on. There will always be a stop/pause button in case the user needs to take a break.
